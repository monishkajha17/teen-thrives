## Problem Statement

<br/>
<blockquote align='center'>
<h3>

"1 in 5 teens between ages twelve and eighteen faces mental health challenges."

\- Adolescent Wellness Academy

</h3>
</blockquote>
<br/>

Teenagers lack accessible and supportive platforms tailored to their unique challenges, leading to feelings of isolation and hindering their ability to seek help. There's a critical need for a comprehensive online platform providing personalized support and resources to promote their mental health and well-being. 

As per the latest data from the American Psychological Association, more than 20% of teens have seriously considered suicide as their last option. This alarming statistic highlights the myriad of problems adolescents face, encompassing mental health issues, social acceptance, and many other key challenges. It is a pressing matter that demands attention and solutions. Our platform is an earnest endeavor to address and alleviate these problems, fostering an environment where teenagers feel accepted, supported, and confident.

### 1. Community Interface

Here, we offer a community interface space where every teenager can freely share their emotions, opinions, perspectives, achievements, and much more. This platform allows them to engage with each other, provide support, and foster a sense of acceptance within the community.

### 2. CBT Bot for Mental Health

Our Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) bot facilitates personalized conversations, monitors mental health, and generates comprehensive reports to support the well-being journey of teenagers. Recognizing that one main factor contributing to mental health issues in teenagers is the feeling of loneliness, our provision of these bots aims to address and alleviate this problem.

### 3. Educational Blog Section

Our educational blog section offers content tailored to the teenage audience, considering factors such as age, gender, and mental health scores. This ensures that teenagers receive relevant education on every aspect of their lives, be it associated with mental or physical health, providing comprehensive coverage on various topics.

### 4. Community and Expert Support Section

In this section, teenagers can explore various communities focused on different factors such as health, academic success, or any other area they find most relevant. They can actively engage within these communities, fostering collaboration and mutual growth. The aim is to cultivate a sense of collaboration within each community, promoting a supportive environment for shared goals and experiences. We also provide a Support section where teenagers can engage with experienced psychologists to obtain more defined solutions for their problems.

### 5. Weekly Learnings

Our Weekly Learning section delivers diverse lessons each week to teens, focusing on essential aspects associated with their body changes and mental well-being. It incorporates various assignments and polls to gather their views on addiction, social issues, bullying, and more. This feedback helps tailor lessons for the upcoming weeks, ensuring that we not only address their current problems but also concentrate on building a better future for both them and the world.

### 6. Mood Tracking and Mental Health Analysis

In our app "Teen Thrives," we offer a mood tracking and mental health analysis feature. Teenagers can track their mood daily, and based on their mood, our Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) bot engages them with thoughtful questions to analyze their emotions and understand the reasons behind their mood. Utilizing this information, the bot provides personalized support and guidance to assist them on their journey.
